# contentful-xamarin-forms
This is a test for using Contentful.Net in a Xamarin.Forms project. It loads a string of content in the main page.

Just edit and put your Contentful's Key, Space Id and Content Id in ContentfulFormsTestPage.xaml.cs and the solution will load the string content into the view at load.

Tested in iOS and Android.
